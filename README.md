Postmortem: Incident Report - Web Application Outage

Issue Summary:

    Duration: June 25, 2024, 9:00 AM - June 25, 2024, 11:30 AM (UTC-5)
    Impact: The user authentication service experienced a complete outage, rendering the login and registration functionalities inaccessible to all users. Approximately 80% of active users attempting to log in during this period were affected.

Root Cause:

    The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the database connection pool settings, leading to a bottleneck under high traffic conditions.

Timeline:

    9:00 AM: Issue detected by monitoring alerts indicating a spike in failed login attempts and database connection timeouts.
    9:15 AM: Incident escalated to the DevOps team as automated recovery measures failed to resolve the issue.
    9:30 AM: Engineers initiated investigations, focusing on database performance metrics and server logs to identify potential causes.
    10:00 AM: Initial assumption pointed towards a database query optimization issue, leading to investigation of recent code deployments and database schema changes.
    10:30 AM: Misleading investigation path: Initial suspicion of a recent code deployment causing database queries to overload was disproved upon closer inspection of deployment timestamps and version control logs.
    11:00 AM: Incident escalated to senior DevOps and Database Administrators (DBAs) for further analysis and resolution planning.
    11:30 AM: Root cause identified as misconfigured database connection pool settings causing database server overload under peak load conditions.

Root Cause and Resolution:

    Root Cause: Misconfigured database connection pool settings caused database server overload.
    Resolution: Updated connection pool configurations to increase maximum connections and optimize query execution times.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Improvements: Implement automated database connection pool monitoring and alerting.
    Tasks:
        Patch database configuration files to optimize connection pool settings.
        Implement enhanced database query caching mechanisms to reduce server load during peak traffic.
        Conduct thorough load testing scenarios to simulate high traffic conditions and ensure system stability.
